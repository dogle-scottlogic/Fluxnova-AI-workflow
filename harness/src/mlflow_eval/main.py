"""MLflow GenAI evaluation for the Fluxnova loan assessment agent subprocess.

This is an MLflow-based alternative to ``deep_eval`` (see
``harness/src/deep_eval/main.py``), covering the same scenarios but using
``mlflow.genai.evaluate`` and MLflow scorers instead of DeepEval metrics.

Two ways to select what to evaluate (use forward slashes for paths — on
Windows Git Bash / MINGW64, backslashes are treated as escape characters and
will mangle the path):

    # A single previously recorded run, read back from the MLflow dataset
    mlflow-eval harness/config/loan-assesment.yml --instance-id <processInstanceId>

    # Every run currently recorded in the MLflow dataset for this process_key
    mlflow-eval harness/config/loan-assesment.yml --all

Add ``--collect`` to either of the above (or on its own) to first pull newly-
completed agentic subprocess runs out of MLflow's trace store (populated by
an OTel Collector exporting straight to MLflow) and record them into the
MLflow evaluation dataset before evaluating. This is an on-demand replacement
for the old always-running ``fluxnova-listener`` service — nothing about
collection needs a background process, since BPMN, MLflow traces, and
Fluxnova's variable history are all already persisted by the time you run
this:

    mlflow-eval harness/config/loan-assesment.yml --collect --all
    mlflow-eval harness/config/loan-assesment.yml --collect            # collect only, don't evaluate

Results are written to a local MLflow tracking store (SQLite) at
``harness/.mlflow/mlflow.db`` and can be browsed with:
    mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///harness/.mlflow/mlflow.db

A summary of the aggregate scorer metrics (MLflow's own ``EvaluationResult``
summary, not a bespoke report) is also printed to stdout.
