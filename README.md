# Fluxnova AI Workflow

A set of tooling, test harness and evaluation framework for Fluxnova workflows that include AI-driven agentic subprocesses.

Goals of this project are:

- Create an Eval Test framework which facilitates Evaluation Driven Design (EDD). This will allow a demo of how you can
  build out an agentic workflow using EDD.
- Add an OTel collector and gen_ai* metrics and tracing with a suitable dashboard. This will allow a demo of real time
  production monitoring.
- Add an Eval task to production level process runs which will facilitate checks on responses and break-glass to a human in
  Production environments.

## Overview

This project is split into three independent Python packages:

1. **`fluxnova-runner`** (`fluxnova-runner/`) — deploys a BPMN workflow to Fluxnova, starts a process instance with
   configurable input variables, drives mock external-task workers, and polls until the sub-process completes.
2. **`fluxnova-mlflow-dataset`** (`fluxnova-mlflow-dataset/`) — a small shared library (no CLI) used by the harness's
   `mlflow-eval` suite. It provides:
    - **collection** (`collect_new_runs`) — an on-demand pre-step (run via `mlflow-eval --collect`, not a background
      service) that finds newly-completed agentic subprocess runs directly in MLflow's own trace store (populated by an
      OTel Collector exporting straight to MLflow), builds an agent-history report by joining that trace data with the
      static BPMN definition and the run's final process variables (read from Fluxnova's core REST API), and upserts it
      into a persistent MLflow evaluation dataset (skip-if-exists/idempotent).
    - **record shaping/read/write** — builds MLflow-dataset records from agent-history data and reads/writes the
      persistent SQLite-backed MLflow evaluation dataset.
3. **`harness`** (`harness/`) — the two evaluation suites:
    - **MLflow evaluation suite** (`mlflow-eval`) — the primary evaluation suite, evaluating agent-history data with
      `mlflow.genai.evaluate` scorers, with results browsable in the MLflow UI. It can evaluate a single ad-hoc report
      file, a single previously recorded run (by process instance ID, read from the MLflow dataset), or every recorded
      run at once — optionally collecting newly-completed runs first (`--collect`).
    - **DeepEval evaluation suite** (`deep-eval`) — *DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE*. Loads an agent-history JSON report and evaluates the
      LLM agent's behaviour using configurable metrics: tool correctness, argument correctness, decision quality,
      evidence citation, and deterministic safety checks. Both evaluation suites can be run independently; neither
      depends on the other, and neither depends on the runner being active at evaluation time (only on the report file /
      trace data / dataset records already produced).

## First time setup

This project assumes you're on **Windows**, using **[Podman](https://podman.io)** for all backing services (Fluxnova
engine, OTel Collector, MLflow), and **Git Bash** as your terminal — every command in this README uses forward-slash
(`/`) paths for that reason. (Backslashes work fine in native PowerShell/`cmd.exe`, but in Git Bash/MINGW64 they're
treated as escape characters and silently mangle paths, e.g. `config\loan-assesment.yml` → `configloan-assesment.yml`
— so forward slashes are used consistently here, since they work in both shells.)

1. **Install prerequisites:**
   - [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation), then start its VM: `podman machine init && podman machine start`
     ([Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io) is recommended, though not required, for a GUI to view/manage pods,
     containers, and logs)
   - Python 3.11+
   - [Ollama](https://ollama.com) with `llama3.2` pulled (`ollama pull llama3.2`) — the judge model used by both
     evaluation suites
   - A locally built/loaded **Fluxnova** container image (not published anywhere) — build it from the eval fork, or
     `podman load -i <fluxnova image tarball>`

2. **Create the shared virtual environment** — all three packages install editable into one venv under
   `harness/.venv`, so changes to any package take effect immediately without reinstalling:
   ```bash
   cd harness
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/Scripts/activate

   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   pip install -e ../fluxnova-mlflow-dataset[dev]
   pip install -e ../fluxnova-runner[dev]
   ```
   This installs four console-script entry points: `fluxnova-run` / `fluxnova-run-mock-workers` (runner), and
   `deep-eval` / `mlflow-eval` (harness evaluation suites).

3. **Start the backing services as Podman pods**, from Git Bash at the repo root:
   ```bash
   cd local-dev
   # adjust .env: set FLUXNOVA_IMAGE to your locally built/loaded image

   ./mlflow-up.sh     # MLflow tracking server + UI — start this first
   ./fluxnova-up.sh   # Fluxnova engine + OTel Collector (posts traces to MLflow)
   ```
   Both scripts open their web UI in your default browser once ready. See
   [`local-dev/README.md`](local-dev/README.md) for the full pod details, the optional `eval-service-worker` pod, and
   Windows/WSL2 troubleshooting.

4. **(One-off) Register the MLflow AI Gateway judge endpoint** — required for automatic evaluation judges. See
   `local-dev/README.md`'s "MLflow AI Gateway endpoint for automatic evaluation judges" section.

You're now ready to run a workflow — see "Running `fluxnova-runner`" below.

## Running `fluxnova-runner` (Windows Git Bash)

From a Git Bash terminal, with `harness/.venv` activated (`source .venv/Scripts/activate` — see Installation above)
and your working directory at `harness/`:

```bash
fluxnova-run config/loan-assesment.yml --with-mock-workers
```

This deploys the BPMN, starts the process instance with the config's `variables`, runs mock external-task workers in the
background to complete each service task, and polls until the process finishes. It prints the **process instance ID** to
the terminal, e.g.:

```
Deploying bpmn/loan-assesment.bpmn …
  Deployed 'Loan Assessment' (id=...)
Starting process 'loanAssessmentProcess' …
  Instance ID: 3816567e-9f94-11f1-9ead-94b609a26547
Waiting for process to complete …
Process 3816567e-9f94-11f1-9ead-94b609a26547 completed.
Run 'mlflow-eval <config> --collect' to record the completed subprocess run into the MLflow evaluation dataset.
```
Other flags:

```bash
fluxnova-run --skip-deploy config/loan-assesment.yml   # BPMN already deployed
fluxnova-run config/loan-assesment.yml                 # no mock workers (needs real service-task workers/backends)
```

### Then evaluate that run with `mlflow-eval` (This will become deprecated)

Make sure the MLflow tracking server is running first (see "Running the MLflow tracking server" below) and the OTel
Collector is exporting to it, then, still from `harness/`:

```bash
mlflow-eval config/loan-assesment.yml --collect --instance-id 3816567e-9f94-11f1-9ead-94b609a26547
```

`--collect` pulls that instance's completed trace out of MLflow's trace store, joins it with the BPMN and Fluxnova's
process-variable history, and records it into the persistent MLflow evaluation dataset; `--instance-id` then immediately
evaluates just that one record and prints the scorer summary to the terminal. See "Running the evaluations (MLflow,
primary)" and "Collecting completed runs" below for the other modes (`--all`, `--collect` alone).

## Running the evaluations (MLflow, primary)

`mlflow-eval` is the primary evaluation suite (`deep-eval` is deprecated) — same config YAML, same underlying
Ollama/llama3.2 judge model, but scored with `mlflow.genai.evaluate` scorers. It supports:

```bash
# 1. A single previously recorded run, read back from the MLflow dataset by process instance ID
mlflow-eval config/loan-assesment.yml --instance-id <instanceId>

# 2. Every run currently recorded in the MLflow dataset for this process_key
mlflow-eval config/loan-assesment.yml --all

# 3. --collect: pull newly-completed runs out of MLflow's trace store first (see below),
#    then evaluate. Can also be used on its own, with no evaluation selector, to only collect.
mlflow-eval config/loan-assesment.yml --collect --all
mlflow-eval config/loan-assesment.yml --collect
```

`mlflow-eval` only evaluates runs already recorded in the persistent MLflow dataset. Use `--collect` first (or on its own) to populate the dataset from MLflow's trace store
before evaluating.

Each of these prints an aggregate metrics summary to the terminal (MLflow's own `EvaluationResult.metrics`) and writes full per-scorer results (scores, rationales, inputs/outputs) to a local SQLite tracking
store at `harness/.mlflow/mlflow.db`.

To view the results in the browser, use the same MLflow tracking server described in "Running the MLflow tracking
server" below (or, if you only need read-only browsing and aren't using `--collect`/OTel ingestion, the lighter-weight
`mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///harness/.mlflow/mlflow.db --port 5000` works too).

Then open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and open the `fluxnova-loanAssessmentProcess` experiment. Each
`mlflow-eval` run appears as a row; click into one to see per-scorer scores and rationales. Running
`mlflow-eval` again against other instances adds further rows to the same experiment for side-by-side comparison.

### Collecting completed runs (`mlflow-eval --collect`)

An OTel Collector exports traces straight to MLflow's own `/v1/traces` endpoint, so MLflow is the trace store.
`mlflow-eval --collect` is a lightweight, on-demand pre-step run each time you want fresh data:

1. Finds every `invoke_agent` trace for the config's `subprocess_id` in MLflow's trace store that isn't already recorded
   (idempotent — skips runs already present, matched by `processInstanceId`).
2. For each one, builds an agent-history report by joining that trace data with the static BPMN definition (system
   prompt, tool input params) and the run's final process variables (read from Fluxnova's
   `/history/variable-instance` API, which stays queryable long after the instance ends).
3. Upserts the result into the persistent MLflow evaluation dataset (`fluxnova-<process_key>` by default).

```bash
mlflow-eval config/loan-assesment.yml --collect
```

```
--collect: processInstanceId=... -> recorded (record_id=...)
```

You still need the OTel Collector configured to export directly to MLflow — add an `otlphttp` exporter pointing at
MLflow's `/v1/traces` endpoint and restart the Collector. `--collect` requires `subprocess_id` to be set in the workflow
config; the `mlflow_dataset.name`/`tracking_uri` config block (if present) is still honoured for where records get
written.

## Alternative: running the MLflow tracking server on the host

First-time setup above uses `local-dev/mlflow-up.sh` (a Podman pod) to run the MLflow tracking server. If you'd
rather run it as a host process instead (e.g. for IDE debugging), `mlflow-eval` can *read* the SQLite store directly
(`sqlite:///harness/.mlflow/mlflow.db`), but for the OTel Collector to *write* traces into it, an actual MLflow
tracking **server** (an HTTP process, not just the library) must be running and listening on the URL the Collector's
`otlphttp` exporter targets (`http://localhost:5000/v1/traces` by default). `mlflow ui` alone does **not** accept
incoming trace writes — it only reads.

Start it (from the repo root, with `harness/.venv` activated) and leave it running in its own terminal for as long as
you want traces to be captured:

```bash
cd harness
.venv/Scripts/mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///.mlflow/mlflow.db --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
```

This single server also serves the browsable UI at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), so once it's running
you no longer need a separate `mlflow ui` process pointed at the same store.

### As an IntelliJ Run/Debug Configuration

1. **Run → Edit Configurations… → + → Python** (requires the Python plugin).
2. **Name:** `MLflow Tracking Server`
3. **Run** (instead of "Script path"): choose **Module name** and set it to `mlflow`, *or* set "Script path" to
   `harness/.venv/Scripts/mlflow.exe` (Windows) / `harness/.venv/bin/mlflow` (macOS/Linux).
4. **Parameters:**
   ```
   server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///.mlflow/mlflow.db --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
   ```
5. **Working directory:** `<repo root>/harness`
6. **Python interpreter:** the `harness/.venv` interpreter (add it via **Add Interpreter → Existing** if not already
   registered).
7. Apply, then run this configuration before starting the OTel Collector or running `fluxnova-run` — leave it running in
   the background for the duration of your session.

## Local development with Podman (Fluxnova + OTel Collector + MLflow)

See [`local-dev/README.md`](local-dev/README.md) for the full details on running the Fluxnova engine, the OTel
Collector, MLflow, and the `eval-service-worker` as Podman pods for local development — including troubleshooting
notes and the MLflow AI Gateway judge-endpoint setup.

## Config file

All harness and evaluation behaviour is driven by a single YAML file.

[Example](harness/config/loan-assesment.yml)

### `expected_tools` rule syntax

Each entry in `expected_tools` is a rule with:

| Key    | Required | Description                                                       |
|--------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tool` | Yes      | Display name of the tool (must match `available_tools` values)    |
| `if`   | No       | Condition string — omit to make the tool unconditionally expected |

**Condition syntax:** `$variableName <op> <value>`

- `$variable` is resolved from `inputVariables` in the agent-history report at evaluation time
- Operators: `==` (equals), `!=` (not equals)
- Values: `"quoted string"`, `true`, `false`, or an integer

Examples:

```yaml
- if: '$applicantType == "EMPLOYED"'   # string comparison
- if: '$hasCollateral == true'          # boolean
- if: '$loanAmount != 0'               # integer
```

## Agent-history report format

The harness fetches this from the Fluxnova subprocess history endpoint and writes it as JSON:

```json
{
  "goal": "Perform a full loan risk assessment for applicant ...",
  "finalOutput": "APPROVE — the applicant meets all lending criteria ...",
  "iterations": 2,
  "inputVariables": {
    "applicantType": "EMPLOYED",
    "hasCollateral": false
  },
  "toolCalls": [
    {
      "toolName": "Check Credit Score",
      "toolElementId": "ServiceTask_CreditScoreCheck",
      "toolInput": "{\"customerId\": \"C001\"}",
      "status": "COMPLETED"
    }
  ],
  "promptMessages": [
    ...
  ],
  "executionTime": 4200
}
```

## Evaluation scorers (MLflow)

`harness/src/mlflow_eval/main.py` covers the same scenarios as the DeepEval suite above, plus a few extra checks added
after reviewing the BPMN's agent prompt and tool wiring:

| Scorer                                                | Type       | Description                                                                     |

| `evidence_citation`                                   | LLM judge  | Output cites fraud/affordability/income evidence (branches on `applicantType`)  |
| `matches_golden`                                      | LLM judge  | Output reaches the same decision as the matching golden scenario                |
| `no_collateral_check_when_no_collateral`              | Code       | Value Collateral is not called when `hasCollateral=false`                       |
| `collateral_valuation_called_correctly_when_required` | Code (new) | Value Collateral **is** called, with the correct `applicationId`, when required |
| `no_bank_statement_for_employed_applicant`            | Code       | Bank statements are not analysed for EMPLOYED applicants                        |

| `all_tool_calls_completed`                            | Code       | Every initiated tool call reached COMPLETED status                              |
| `step_efficiency`                                     | Code       | Agent completes within a budget of loop iterations (+1 if collateral required)  |
| `requested_amount_passed_to_affordability`            | Code       | Affordability tool receives the correct `customerId` and `requestedAmount`      |
| `affordability_called_after_income_confirmed`         | Code (new) | Affordability is assessed only after income has been confirmed                  |


## Evaluation tests (DeepEval)

| Test                                            | Metric                                     | Description                                                            |

## Running the evaluations (DeepEval, deprecated)

> `deep-eval` requires an agent-history JSON report file as input. Since `fluxnova-runner` no longer produces one
> itself (see above), use `mlflow-eval` instead (below) unless you already have a report file from another source.

```bash
# Via the entry point (recommended — generates both the DeepEval score summary and an HTML report)
deep-eval config/loan-assesment.yml \
          .fluxnova/loanAssessmentProcess/<instanceId>.json
```

Two reports are written on every run (pass or fail):

| Report                 | Location                                        |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| DeepEval score summary | printed to terminal at end of session           |
| HTML report            | `.fluxnova/<processKey>/<instanceId>-eval.html` |

```bash
# Via the deepeval CLI directly (also generates the DeepEval score summary)
deepeval test run src/deep_eval/main.py \
    --config config/loan-assesment.yml \
    --report .fluxnova/loanAssessmentProcess/<instanceId>.json

# Via pytest (HTML report only — no DeepEval score summary)
pytest src/deep_eval/main.py -v \
    --config config/loan-assesment.yml \
    --report .fluxnova/loanAssessmentProcess/<instanceId>.json \
    --html .fluxnova/loanAssessmentProcess/<instanceId>-eval.html \
    --self-contained-html
```
