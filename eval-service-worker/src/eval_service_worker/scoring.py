"""Scores one just-completed agentic subprocess run against a set of scorers —
the nondeterministic ``decision_quality`` LLM judge plus trace-only
deterministic checks (required tool calls, no tool errors, a definitive
decision keyword) — reading trace data only (no BPMN parsing, no Fluxnova REST
API calls). See EVAL-SERVICE-WORKER-PLAN.md.

Uses ``mlflow.genai.evaluate(data=[{"trace": trace}], scorers=[...])`` (rather
than a bare ``mlflow.log_feedback`` call per scorer) so that:

- every scorer's ``Feedback`` is logged back onto the *same* real agentic
  subprocess trace (confirmed empirically — passing an existing ``Trace``
  object via the ``trace`` column attaches assessments to it directly, not to
  a newly-synthesized one), and
- MLflow registers a proper "Evaluation Run" grouping all of them together
  (visible under MLflow's Evaluations UI) — not just isolated per-trace
  assessments with no run to group them.
