"""Configuration for the ``eval-service-worker`` standalone service.

Deliberately **not** read from ``harness``'s workflow YAML config
(``harness/config/loan-assesment.yml``) — this worker is meant to be a slim,
independently deployable service (its own Podman pod/container), and depending
on another service's config file for its own connection settings would
recreate exactly the coupling that was avoided everywhere else (no BPMN
parsing, no Fluxnova REST calls — see ``EVAL-SERVICE-WORKER-PLAN.md``).

Instead, all settings are simple hardcoded defaults below, overridable via CLI
flags or environment variables (see ``main.py``) — there's only ever one
workflow being scored in this demo, so a config file of its own would just be
one more thing to keep in sync for no real benefit.
